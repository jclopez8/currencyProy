exchangeRate.validFrom.help=The date from which this exchange rate is to take effect. There can only be one rate per currency per day, at most.
exchangeRate.rate.help=The exchange rate with a maximum of six digits after the decimal point. Exchange rates must be greater than zero! The rate you enter here is the \
number by which you would multiply a base currency amount by to get the equivalent worth in this currency. For example, if the base currency was US Dollars \
